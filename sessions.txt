How Sessions Work

- When we do 'req.session.userId = user.id;' - we are storing data into session

it will take {userId: 1} -> And send this to redis 
Redis is a Key Lookup store 

1
key is the value e.g. qerouhqrouqern and will return us this data {userId:1}
sess:qerouhqrouqern -> {userId: 1}

2
express-session will set a cookie on my browser and look like e.g. qerq8urq08qjjenqw (a signed version of the key for redis) 

3
We take this signed key on the users browser (when the user makes a request) 
qerq8urq08qjjenqw -> sent to the server 

Decrypt our cookie and get the key for redis and make a request to redis
4
qerq8urq08qjjenqw -> sess:qerouhqrouqern

5
Make a request to redis 
sess:qerouhqrouqern -> {userId:1}

6.
stores req.session = {userId:1}
